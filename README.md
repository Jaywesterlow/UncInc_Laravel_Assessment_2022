# Train of thoughts

## Initial thoughts
Once I heard about the projects we were assigned to make, I had to choose which of the 2 assignments I'd start with. Even though I've already made a Laravel-8 project before, I still chose to start with React because of the experience I had with Laravel and specifically the time it had taken me to start up in my previous Laravel project. In my train of though, it would've been too time consuming.

## Problem
I spent too much time on react and didn't manage my time correctly. This is why I **did not make** the Laravel project. I did start my research and followed a README.md for windows (the README.md file that I'd received from your company was for Linux), but came to the realization there simply was no time left for this project and instead i'd just have settle with writing down my train of thoughts.

## Plan of action
What I understood from the README.md file, was that the point of this project was to make a authentication system where someone cannot enter without an API token.

1.  I generate a token using the commandline
2.  I'd make use of Laravel's 'Middleware' authentication to gatekeep anyone without a token.
3.  ik heb een filter systeem gemaakt waardoor je alleen jouw informatie ziet van de api token.
4.  I'd make a filter which resticts users from viewing any information except from their own API token.

## Final thoughts
I don't have much to conclude to other than to, in the future, creating a hierarchy of what's most important to do, then properly manage my time.
